Objective - 

Go through this repository: https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar (Links to an external site.)
Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository and add it to your API/repo. 
Use your data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
Your Target is 85% accuracy. No limit on the number of epochs. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed). 

Results -
