<h1>Session 15 - Monocular Depth Estimation and Segmentation</h1>
<br>

<b>Objective</b>
Given an image with foreground objects and background image, predict the depth map as well as a mask for the foreground object.

<b>Dataset</b>
A custom dataset will be used to train this model, which consists of:

<li>100 background images
<li>400k foreground overlayed on background images
<li>400k masks for the foreground overlayed on background images
<li>400k depth maps for the foreground overlayed on background images
